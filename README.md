# Excel-Customer-Analysis
In this Excel-based customer data analysis project, I first focused on data cleaning to ensure reliability of the dataset. This involved identifying and removing duplicate customer records and correcting inconsistent or incorrect entries that could affect analysis results. After cleaning the data, I processed and enriched it by creating additional, analysis-ready fields using XLOOKUP, and applied conditional formatting to highlight patterns, errors, and inconsistencies, making data validation easier.

Once the data was prepared, I used Pivot Tables to analyze customer behavior and answer key business questions such as trends, segmentation, and performance metrics, which supported data-driven decision-making. Finally, I designed an interactive Excel dashboard using slicers and Power Query, allowing users to filter and explore the data easily and view insights in a clear, structured, and user-friendly format.
