# Excel-Customer-Analysis
Project Purpose
The purpose of this project was to analyze customer sales data to understand purchasing patterns, customer demographics, and regional performance. The objective was to answer key business questions related to sales trends, customer segments, and platform preferences, and to provide actionable insights that could help improve targeting, marketing strategies, and overall business performance.


Methodology

Data Cleaning
The project began with cleaning the raw customer dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. Duplicate records were identified and removed using conditional formatting, which helped highlight repeated entries efficiently. Inconsistent and incorrect data values were corrected to prepare a clean dataset suitable for analysis.

Data Processing
After cleaning, the data was processed and enriched by creating new relevant fields using XLOOKUP, IF statements, and text manipulation functions. These transformations helped standardize categories, derive meaningful variables, and make the dataset analysis-ready.

Data Analysis
Once the data was prepared, Pivot Tables were used to analyze the data and answer various business questions related to sales performance, customer demographics, delivery status, platform usage, and regional trends. Different pivot tables were created to explore distributions, comparisons, and trends across multiple dimensions.

Data Visualization & Dashboard
Charts were created from each Pivot Table to visually represent trends and distributions in the data. These charts were then combined into a single interactive Excel dashboard, with appropriate formatting for clarity and readability. Slicers were added to enable dynamic filtering based on different variables such as month, gender, state, age group, and sales platform. For example, slicers allowed analysis of gender-wise gross sales for a specific month.



Key Findings & Insights

1. The highest number of sales occurred in March.
2. Women contributed 64.05% of total sales, making them the dominant customer segment.
3. The majority of orders were successfully delivered, indicating strong operational performance.
4. Maharashtra and Karnataka emerged as the highest-performing states in terms of sales.
5. Customers in the adult age group (20–55 years) placed the most orders, with women leading within this segment.
6. Most purchases were made through Amazon and Myntra platforms.

Business Insight

Based on the analysis, the business should focus marketing efforts on women aged 20–55 in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Promotional strategies such as targeted campaigns and discount coupons on Amazon and Myntra are likely to drive higher engagement and sales.
